    A full stack developer is an engineer who can handle all the work<br> 
    of databases, servers, systems engineering, and clients.
    </p>
    <p>As one of the hottest topics for developers, the discussions have never stopped.<br> 
        On LinkedIn and Facebook, lots of people put their job title as a full stack developer.<br>
        Besides, it seems that the “Full Stack” topic has already become a new job trend.<br>
        An article on Medium has discussed the full stack designer getting both praise and blame.<br>
        Some people think that the full stack is just a title, <br>
        what he/she should focus on is the real personal ability and technology.</p>

        Essentially, I think the discussion about the full stack is also a kind of argument relating to<br>
        the all-rounder and expertin the IT industry, and debate on the depth and breadth of development skills.
